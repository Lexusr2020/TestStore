-----------Install Choco -------------

    With PowerShell, you must ensure Get-ExecutionPolicy is not Restricted. We suggest using Bypass to bypass the policy to get things installed or AllSigned for quite a bit more security.

    Run Get-ExecutionPolicy. If it returns Restricted, then run Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned or Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process.
    Now run the following command:
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

----------Step 3: Connect to an existing theme ------------------------

    theme get --list --password=your-password --store=your-store.myshopify.com
    themes avaialable will be listed
    copy the one you want to work on


---------------Step 4: Set up your config file---------------------------
    A config.yml file creates a local connection to your Shopify storeâ€™s theme. You can use the previous information you collected (Theme Kit password and theme ID) to create a config.yml file in your theme, and then download the theme locally.

        Steps:
            Create a directory for your theme:
            Terminal - mkdir [your-theme-name]

            Navigate to the new directory:
            Terminal - cd [your-theme-name]

            To download a specific theme, and create the config.yml file that connects this theme with a local version in the directory you just created, run the following command:
            Terminal - theme get --password=[your-password] --store="[your-store.myshopify.com]" --themeid=[your-theme-id]


----------Step 5: Create a new theme ------------------------

    theme new --password=[your-password] --store="[your-store.myshopify.com]" --name=[theme name]


------------Step 6: Get theme list-----------------------
    theme get --list --password=[your-password] --store="[your-store.myshopify.com]"

------------Step 7: Push updates to your theme -----------------------
    Now that you've established a connection to a Shopify theme, you can run the following command in your theme directory:

    Terminal: theme watch
